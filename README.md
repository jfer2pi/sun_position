# sun_position
 Solar position calculator with true-tracking and backtracking options
 
 ## Purpose
 
 The purpose of this code is to provide R users the capability to calculate solar position given a latitude angle.  This work is based partially on my Solar Energy Master's, where a previous assignment involved creating code that would be able to do just this.  I have expanded it by adding optimal tracker and backtracking calculations given a GCR as well.
